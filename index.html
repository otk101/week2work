<h1>About Me</h1>
<p align="justify"> I am Kenya Ortega. I live in Georgia with my husband of 14 years and my two dogs. I am not really new to tech--I have an M.Ed. (Master of Education) in Instructional Technology, which is a STEM degree--but I am not above learning something new!  My hobbies (in no particular order) include video games, making music, watching movies and soap operas, writing, reading, playing board and dice games, playing with my pets, cooking, and traveling. However, my one true passion has always been arts and crafts.</p>
<h1>My Goals for This Training</h1>
<p>I plan to use this "bootcamp" to:
<ul>
  <li>Update my skills set</li>
  <li>Learn new techniques</li>
  <li>Become a "real" coder</li>
  <li>Network with like-minded individuals</li>
  <li>Benefit from constructive criticism</li>
  <li>Improve my resume/CV</li>
</ul>
